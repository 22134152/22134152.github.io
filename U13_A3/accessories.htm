      <p>A phone case is a necessity  for when you first buy a phone. This is crucial because when you buy a phone of any kind if you drop it or damage it in any way then you will very quickly lose lots of money whereas if you get a phone case then drop your phone you will be less likely to break your brand new phone. </p>
