<h1> Unit 1 introduction </h1>
<p> Unit 1, titled "The Online World," was a mandatory part of the ICT course. Unlike many other units that focused on project work, this one was in a computer-based exam. In this unit,
 you acquired knowledge about the internet and how to use it responsibly. In this unit, we learnt a lot of the basics like how websites work, how emails reach your computer and how the 
 use of computer applications affects your daily life. This unit provided an introduction to the modern online world. Because of this unit, I extended my knowledge of online services 
 and investigated the technology and software that support them. I also learnt more about a range of services including email, online data storage, collaborative software, search engines 
 and blogging. This unit helped me understand the main technologies and processes behind the Internet and investigate how they come together to let us view websites.

<h1>
What results I recieved
</h1>
<p>
In this Unit I struggled and only recieved a level 1 pass, this result could be better but it could also be much better unfortunately. Overall im unhappy about this because I know that I definitely could have done much better.
