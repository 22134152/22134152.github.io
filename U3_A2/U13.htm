<h1> What I did in unit 13 </h1>

<p> unit 13 was all about designing a website for a company using HTML my website was good although including a few problems it was still 
a very good website that worked really well. this unit was based a lot around the planning documentation we did before designing the final website.
 overall I am very happy with how my final design came out. </p>

<h1> what results did I get </h1>
<p> In this unit I managed to achieve a merit what I am very happy with although not the best grade possible it is still very good. 
If I was to do this unit again I believe that I could push to potentially achieve a better grade but a merit does still give me lots of help towards my desired grade. </p>
