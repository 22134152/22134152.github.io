	  <p> The code behind this assignment, while not incredibly complicated, required a significant amount of creativity in its design. It also required extensive planning, which is detailed in the PDF linked below. I spent time thinking of potential ideas and thinking outside the box to come up with creative solutions. Furthermore, I incorporated various new components and enhanced existing features to improve functionality and effectiveness, ensuring the project met its goals. 
The overall process involved thorough testing to ensure that all aspects worked well together, identifying and resolving any issues that arose. You can explore the complete planning documentation, the added elements, and the testing results by referring to the linked PDF which you can find below. This will give you a deeper understanding of our approach and the steps we took to achieve the final product.

The PDF below contains some of the course work that I have created this year to plan for making my mobile app. The PDF includes a structure chart along with storyboards for each page that I designed. The app that I created was only a preview of what the actual app would look like and the fully designed app would include more pages for different letters and more features potentially including a back button.
