<h1> What I did in unit 8 </h1>
<p> In Unit 8, we focused on the exciting journey of designing a mobile application specifically designed for children aged 3 to 7 years old. From the very beginning of this unit, 
I was confident that this would be one of my key strengths. I'm proud to say that my final product not only looked incredible but also met the 
needs of my target audience. I felt a great sense of accomplishment as I knew that I did a great job. </p>
