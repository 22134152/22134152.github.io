	  <p> This unit needed a lot of planning documentation, none of it was incredibly complicated though. This unit had 4 different main assignments which when combined together made up 
	  2 assignments planning the website, 1 assignment making the website and finally 1 assignment for an evaluation of the completed website and what you could change. </p>

	  Below is a PDF file of some of the coursework I created when planning to design my website. the PDF includes a basic explanation of what my website will promote and include along with a few storyboards (one for each webpage.) finally the PDF also includes a little more information about improvements I could have made which also includes potentially gathering feedback which I didn't do.
